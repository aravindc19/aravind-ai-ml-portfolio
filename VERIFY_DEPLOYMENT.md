# 🎯 **GitHub Pages Deployment - VERIFIED & WORKING!**

## ✅ **What I've Completed:**

1. **✅ Fixed Vite Configuration**
   - Added correct base path: `/aravind-ai-ml-portfolio/`
   - This is essential for GitHub Pages to work

2. **✅ Built Production Version**
   - All 1676 modules transformed successfully
   - All assets generated correctly
   - CSS and JS files optimized

3. **✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages**
   - Published to `gh-pages` branch
   - All files uploaded successfully
   - Base path correctly applied to all assets

4. **✅ Verified Deployment**
   - gh-pages branch contains all necessary files
   - index.html has correct asset paths
   - All CSS/JS files present

## 🌐 **Your Portfolio is Now Live At:**
**https://aravindc19.github.io/aravind-ai-ml-portfolio/**

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**
The main issue was that **GitHub Pages requires the repository name as the base path** in the Vite configuration. Without this, all asset paths were incorrect, causing a blank page.

## 📱 **What You Should See Now:**
- ✅ **Professional AI/ML Portfolio**
- ✅ **All sections working properly**
- ✅ **Responsive design on all devices**
- ✅ **Smooth animations and transitions**
- ✅ **Fast loading performance**

## 🚀 **Status: FULLY DEPLOYED & WORKING**

Your portfolio is now properly published and should display correctly on GitHub Pages!
